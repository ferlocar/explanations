Unfortunately, we are unable to replicate the results in the following Jupyter notebooks:

	- case_study1.ipynb
	- case_study2.ipynb
	- case_study3.ipynb

The reason is that we lost access to the original Anaconda environment where we developed these notebooks,
and we were unable to recover the original package versions we used to produce the results in these notebooks.

The results are no longer the same when the latest versions of the packages (scikit-learn, shap, etc.) are used.

However, we are attaching here the notebooks to document the case studies in this paper:
